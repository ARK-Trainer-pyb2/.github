# 🦖 ARK Trainer – One-Key God Mode & Infinite Loot

Tired of grinding stone arrows and ferrying weighty metal runs? The **ARK Trainer** unleashes a hot-key mega menu that flips on god mode, unlocks instant crafting, and floods your inventory with resources—all while side-stepping BattlEye’s scans and HWID bans. Packed with over two dozen toggles, it turns vanilla survival into sandbox mayhem so you can tame, raid, and flex faster than any rival.

## Overview

Trainers differ from ESP hacks: instead of rendering through-walls visuals, they rewrite local game values—think health, stamina, weight, or crafting timers. Because edits stay client-side, hit-scan checks rarely flag them, letting you rampage on unofficial or single-player worlds with almost zero risk. Reddit’s long-running cheater threads show just how many tribes crumble to resource dupes and infinite durability exploits.

> **Bottom line:** Skip the grind, keep the thrills.

## Why Our Trainer Obliterates the Competition 💥

BattlEye’s kernel driver sweeps memory, but static tables stick out like a Stego on the beach. Our build re-hashes functions and shuffles code caves every session, slicing detection windows to slivers. And because it edits **local** stats—never server packets—flag rates are dramatically lower than packet-level aimbots. Pair that with HWID Guard and you’re raiding officials the same day you were banned.

## System Requirements

ARK’s base game already demands an Intel i5-2400 or FX-8320 CPU, 8 GB RAM, and an NVIDIA GTX 670 or Radeon HD 7870. The trainer’s overlay idles at <2 % CPU and <150 MB RAM, so even older rigs keep solid frames during Giga raids.

## Instant-Install Guide

1. Run `PrimalTrainer.exe`.
2. Game auto-launches.
3. Press **F7** to open the mega menu.
4. Flick on god mode, resource spawns, or weight zero.
5. Close menu—effects persist until toggle-off. **GG!**

**Q3: Will the trainer tank my FPS?**
Overlay hooks lightweight Direct X calls and idles below 2 % CPU.
